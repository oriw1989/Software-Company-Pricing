# Software-Company-Pricing
In this Jupyter notebook, we study an A/B test by a software company that is looking to possibly increase the price of its software. We conclude that the data is indicating that an increase in price is favorable. We also study user segments and conclude the same for all segments, with the results for some segments being stronger than others.
